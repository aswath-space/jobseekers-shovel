# Repository Overview

This repository is a single-owner, agent-assisted project workspace.

It is structured to clearly separate intent, execution, and historical record.
Humans and AI agents must interact with this repository according to the rules
defined below and in AGENTS.md.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository follows a fixed workflow:

1. **PRD.md** defines what should exist and what must not.
2. **TASKLIST.md** lists all permissible actions.
3. **CHANGELOG.md** records what has actually changed.
4. **AGENTS.md** governs how AI agents behave.

General rules:
- Do not perform work that is not represented in TASKLIST.md.
- Do not introduce new intent outside PRD.md.
- Do not explain reasoning in CHANGELOG.md.

README.md provides orientation only and is not a source of truth.
